My research interests are in robotics, vision, and artificial intelligence. My advisors are [Ali Farhadi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ali/) and [Dieter Fox](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~fox/). I also closely work with [Andrzej Pronobis](https://www.pronobis.pro/). I received M.S. and B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Seoul National University and I was advised by [Kyoung Mu Lee](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/kmlee/). Prior to UW, I worked at Korea Institute of Science and Technology as a researcher.
